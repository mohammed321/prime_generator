# prime number generator

I use the Miller–Rabin primality test to generate primes in a certain range.

you can read about the Miller–Rabin primality test at [Miller–Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)

### to compile it just run the following:
```bash
gcc main.c -o prime_generator
```

### to run run the following:
```bash
